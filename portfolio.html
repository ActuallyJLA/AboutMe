				I have been a developer for many years and have learned many different technologies during that time. I have proven over and over again that I can adapt to any environment and learn any programming language. This page has links to various projects I created in my spare time using some of the web technologies I have learned.

					These are my family history pages. I originally built thim many years ago using basic html. They contains links to surnames pages which then link to individuals. The surname and individual pages were created programatically using ged2html script and C++ to parse a gedcom database into web pages. I have recently gone back and modernized them to use CSS and a little bit of javascript.

					Home staging is a business that is all about the design. Therefore, clients want to see examples of the stager's work. This is the website I create for a local home staging company to showcase their work. It was created for them using html, css, and javascript.

					Budding Hollywood screen writers need a place to promote their works and showcase the projects they have worked on. This site shows the projects worked on by one fairly recent University of Southern California (USC) graduate. This one uses javascript to sort either by project or credit.

					Podcasts are very popular these days. This site contains info about podcasts that is searchable by person or shows. It is built with Spring MVC, Java, JSP, and uses a MySQL database to house the data. I also created a password protected Create, Read, Update, and Delete Application for data entry. You cannot link to that application. However, the code is in my Github site. See below.</a>

					This page is a MADLIBS game I did as part of learning HTML, CSS, and javascript. This is stored on JSFiddle.net which is a cool tool for experimenting with and debugging your html/css/javascript projects. It allows you to see all three components and the current output from them at the same time. FYI... there is also a similar tool for debugging SQL scripts called 
					SQL Fiddle.

					Radish Systems hired me to create a demo showing how to integrate their ChoiceView(tm) WEBAPI (REST) with the Twilio API to create a True Visual IVR(tm) on the Twilio platform. This demo was created using C#.
